An email gateway wants to test whether the email contains the keyword ``urgent'' so that it could route the email accordingly. Alice, on the other hand does not wish to give the gateway the ability to decrypt all her messages. We define and construct a mechanism that enables Alice to provide a key to the gateway that enables the gateway to test whether the word ``urgent'' is a keyword in the email without learning anything else about the email. We refer to this mechanism as Public Key Encryption with keyword Search. As another example, consider a mail server that stores various messages publicly encrypted for Alice by others. Using our mechanism Alice can send the mail server a key that will enable the server to identify all messages containing some specific keyword, but learn nothing else. We define the concept of public key encryption with keyword search and give several constructions.},

In order to retrieve documents satisfying a certain search criterion, the user gives the server a capability that allows the server to identify exactly those documents. Work in this area has largely focused on search criteria consisting of a single keyword. If the user is actually interested in documents containing each of several keywords (conjunctive keyword search) the user must either give the server capabilities for each of the keywords individually and rely on an intersection calculation (by either the server or the user) to determine the correct set of documents, or alternatively, the user may store additional information on the server to facilitate such searches. Neither solution is desirable; the former enables the server to learn which documents match each individual keyword of the conjunctive search and the latter results in exponential storage if the user allows for searches on every set of keywords.},

Our first scheme is based on Shamir Secret Sharing and provides the most efficient search technique in this context to date. Although the size of its trapdoors is linear in the number of documents being searched, we empirically show that this overhead remains reasonable in practice. Nonetheless, to address this limitation we provide an alternative based on bilinear pairings that yields constant size trapdoors. This latter construction is not only asymptotically more efficient than previous secure conjunctive keyword search schemes in the symmetric setting, but incurs significantly less storage overhead. Additionally, unlike most previous work, our constructions are proven secure in the standard model.},

  abstract  = {The recently proposed Oblivious Cross-Tags (OXT) protocol (CRYPTO 2013) has broken new ground in designing efficient searchable symmetric encryption (SSE) protocol with support for conjunctive keyword search in a single-writer single-reader framework. While the OXT protocol offers high performance by adopting a number of specialised data-structures, it also trades-off security by leaking 'partial' database information to the server. Recent attacks have exploited similar partial information leakage to breach database confidentiality. Consequently, it is an open problem to design SSE protocols that plug such leakages while retaining similar efficiency. In this paper, we propose a new SSE protocol, called Hidden Cross-Tags (HXT), that removes 'Keyword Pair Result Pattern' (KPRP) leakage for conjunctive keyword search. We avoid this leakage by adopting two additional cryptographic primitives - Hidden Vector Encryption (HVE) and probabilistic (Bloom filter) indexing into the HXT protocol. We propose a 'lightweight' HVE scheme that only uses efficient symmetric-key building blocks, and entirely avoids elliptic curve-based operations. At the same time, it affords selective simulation-security against an unbounded number of secret-key queries. Adopting this efficient HVE scheme, the overall practical storage and computational overheads of HXT over OXT are relatively small (no more than 10% for two keywords query, and 21% for six keywords query), while providing a higher level of security.},

By tactfully leveraging the RSA-function, our protocol avoids the per-query interaction between the data owner and the client, thus reducing the communication overhead significantly and eliminating the need of the data owner to provide the online services to clients at all times. Furthermore, our protocol manages to protect the query privacy of clients to some extent, meaning that our protocol hides the exact queries from the data owner. In terms of the leakage to server, it is exactly the same as Cash et al., thus achieving the same security against the adversarial server. In addition, by employing attribute-based encryption technique, our protocol also realizes the fine-grained access control on the stored data. To be compatible with our RSA-based approach, we also present a deterministic and memory-efficient `keyword to prime' hash function, which may be of independent interest.},

In order to achieve fine-grained access control, the identifiers are encrypted by the attribute-based encryption. In this case, the user can decrypt a ciphertext only when the access policy in it matches the user's attribute set. However, the server unable to determine whether the user can decrypt a certain ciphertext without the knowledge of the user's attribute set. As a result, all the ciphertexts based on a search token have to be returned to the user, which causes unnecessary communication and decryption costs. In this paper, we propose a new SMSE scheme, in which the server just needs to return the ones which can be decrypted by the user rather than the whole search results. In order to achieve this goal, we present a server-side match technique with which the server can test whether the user can decrypt a ciphertext without knowing the user's attribute set. Furthermore, the decryption computation is very efficient, irrespective of the structure of access policy. Therefore, both the communication and decryption overheads are dramatically reduced in our scheme.},

In a public cloud the infrastructure is owned and managed by a cloud service provider and is located in the provider's control. To protect the privacy of sensitive data, documents have to be encrypted before outsourcing. When the number of encrypted documents increases exponentially, the search service and retrieval becomes critical. The process of retrieving the files containing the queried keyword further incurs unnecessary network traffic, which is absolutely undesirable in pay-as-you-use cloud paradigm. In this paper, a search scheme that provides both privacy protection and rank-ordered search capability with less overhead has been proposed. Search indexes and documents are first encrypted by the data owner and then stored onto the cloud server. Retrieval results on an encrypted data and security analysis under different attack models show that data privacy can be preserved while retaining very good retrieval performance.},

Although encryption helps protecting user data confidentiality, it leaves the well-functioning yet practically-efficient secure search functions over encrypted data a challenging problem. In this paper, we present a privacy-preserving multi-keyword text search (MTS) scheme with similarity-based ranking to address this problem. To support multi-keyword search and search result ranking, we propose to build the search index based on term frequency and the vector space model with cosine similarity measure to achieve higher search result accuracy. To improve the search efficiency, we propose a tree-based index structure and various adaption methods for multi-dimensional (MD) algorithm so that the practical search efficiency is much better than that of linear search. To further enhance the search privacy, we propose two secure index schemes to meet the stringent privacy requirements under strong threat models, i.e., known ciphertext model and known background model. Finally, we demonstrate the effectiveness and efficiency of the proposed schemes through extensive experimental evaluation.},

  abstract  = {There exist many large collections of private data that must be protected on behalf of the entities that hold them or the clients they serve. However, there are also often many legitimate reasons for sharing that data in a controlled manner. How can two parties decide to share data without prior knowledge of what data they have? For example, two intelligence agencies might be willing to cooperate by sharing documents about a specific case, and need a way of determining which documents might be of interest to each other.We introduce and address the problem of allowing such entities to search each other's data securely and anonymously. We aim to protect the content of the queries, as well as the content of documents unrelated to those queries, while concealing the identity of the participants. Although there exist systems for solving similar problems, to our knowledge we are the first to address this specific need and also the first to present a secure anonymous search system that is practical for real-time querying. In order to achieve this in an efficient manner, we make use of Bloom filters [5], definitions of security for deterministic encryption [22] that we adapt and instantiate in the private key setting and of a novel encryption primitive, reroutable encryption.},
